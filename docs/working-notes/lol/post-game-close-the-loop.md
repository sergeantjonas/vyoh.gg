# Post-game close-the-loop surface — roadmap

**Status:** Shipped — PG1 + PG2 + PG3 (Profile-framing close-the-loop) all shipped 2026-05-13; PG2 live-verified 2026-05-14. PG4 (peer-route post-game artifact) closed as won't-do 2026-05-20: PG1–PG3 has been live and verified for six days; the close-the-loop value lands on Profile and a separate share-friendly route/OG-image artifact is not load-bearing. Re-promote from this doc's decision log if a "share my game" surface ever surfaces as a distinct need.

After-game counterpart to [Pregame Ritual](../../../apps/web/src/lol/profile/profile-pregame-ritual.tsx). Promoted from [vnext-ideas.md](../cross-cutting/vnext-ideas.md) ("Top tier — eye-catching wins") and [app-state-analysis.md](app-state-analysis.md) (broader-app gap #1) into a tracked arc because it is the **single highest-payoff missing surface** in the LoL section and the strongest case-study candidate currently in the backlog.

Read this when starting the arc, or when the question is "what's the next big visible-payoff feature."

## Premise

The app currently helps the user *before* and *during* a game:

- **Pregame Ritual** (4 signals: form, tilt, time slot, top champion) frames the decision to queue.
- **Live page** (server-side polling + SSE) covers the in-game read.

There is no equivalent for *after* a game. The most emotionally charged moment in the play loop — the minutes after a win or a loss — is currently a blank space in the app. Every other companion app shares this gap. The verdict pattern (`ConclusionCard`), the calm-coaching tonal bet, and the SSE infrastructure that already pushes new-match events to the client all point at the same thing: this is a surface waiting to be built on primitives that already exist.

The frame for the surface itself: **"that one just landed, here's the read."** Not gamified, not celebratory, not a scoreboard — a one-glance after-game block that surfaces what the user would otherwise have to assemble manually from form, tilt, time-slot, and champion deltas.

---

## What signals exist

Most of the work is composition, not new computation. Inputs available today:

| Signal | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Outcome | `MatchSummary.win` | Trivially derived. |
| Streak break / extension | Form computation in [`profile-pregame-ritual.tsx`](../../../apps/web/src/lol/profile/profile-pregame-ritual.tsx) `buildFormSignal` | Mirror it for post-game framing. |
| Game length | `MatchSummary.gameDurationSec` | Cluster by short / normal / long for verdict shading. |
| Tilt risk after this game | `buildTiltSignal` logic | Same primitive; phrasing flips ("you tilt 30% more after this kind of loss"). |
| Performance vs personal baseline | `damageShare`, `visionScore`, KDA, `csAt15` | Already present on `MatchSummary` via Phase A/B trends backfill. |
| Champion delta vs account average | Champion detail delta tiles | Re-use the per-champion vs personal-baseline computation. |
| Next time slot read | `buildTimeSlotSignal` | "Your next ranked is in your worst slot — Tue 23:00, 38% historical WR." |
| First-blood, lane-phase, comeback | Phase B fields (`teamGoldDiffAt15`, `deathTimings`) | Adds depth where the user lost in lane but won the game, or vice versa. |

**No new schema, no new Riot calls.** Everything composes from `MatchSummary` + the existing pregame primitives.

## Design — what the surface actually is

A `ConclusionCard`-shaped block with 3–4 signals, mirroring Pregame Ritual's structure but inverted in tone — what *happened* rather than what to *consider*. Reuses the existing `RitualSignal` model so the visual language matches the pregame surface and the user reads them as a paired set.

**Candidate signals for v1 (pick 3 or 4):**

1. **Outcome read** — *"4-game win streak now"*, *"first loss after 3"*, *"your seventh ranked game today — you usually stop at 5"*.
2. **Performance vs your baseline** — *"+18% damage share above your ADC average"*, *"vision investment below your norm (-12)"*. One highlight, not a dump.
3. **Tilt forecast** — *"you go -X% in the next game after a 30+ minute loss; consider stepping away"*. Same data as pregame tilt, framed as a forward read.
4. **Champion read** — *"your worst result on Vex in 14 games — patch 14.20"* or *"matches your Vex average exactly"*.
5. **Next-slot framing** — *"your next ranked window is Tue 23:00, your weakest slot"*.

Pick the 3–4 with the highest signal-to-noise per game; deterministically choose which signals fire based on data presence (the existing `RitualSignal.tone` model already supports "muted" empty paths).

**Prescription field (optional, only on high-confidence cases):**

- "Take a break" (after consecutive losses or a long loss).
- "One more is fine — your form is up." (after a win streak inside the user's historical comfort range).
- "Check the matchup tab — your last 3 vs Yasuo went poorly." (after a recurring lane loss).

The prescription must never be ambient. If there's no clear read, it's omitted — same rule as the trends tiles.

## Surface placement — open decision

Three viable homes:

### Option A — Profile section, always visible

A new block on Profile, paired visually with Pregame Ritual. Pregame on the left, Post-game on the right (or above/below depending on rank-snapshot density). Reads the most-recent match for the active account.

- **Pro:** zero new routing, zero new triggers, lands as a static dashboard read every time the user opens Profile.
- **Pro:** pairs visually with Pregame Ritual — symmetrical bookends.
- **Con:** less moment-aware; reads the same yesterday's loss as a fresh one until a new match arrives.

### Option B — Route segment that opens on SSE arrival

A peer route at `/lol/$accountSlug/post-game/$matchId` that the app auto-navigates to (or opens as a modal layer) when the SSE backfill worker reports a new completed match. Closes back to wherever the user was.

- **Pro:** moment-aware; appears exactly when the user finishes a game.
- **Pro:** strong "this app is alive" signal — a calm artifact that materializes after each match.
- **Con:** auto-navigation is intrusive; needs an explicit opt-in or a non-blocking entry.
- **Con:** more routing surface area; deeper interaction with the SSE invalidation flow.

### Option C — Static Profile section + auto-expand on SSE

Hybrid: section always exists on Profile, but on SSE arrival the section animates open / pulses / highlights without forcing navigation. User sees the read where they expect it.

- **Pro:** moment-aware without being intrusive.
- **Pro:** the easiest of the three to back out of if the framing doesn't land.
- **Con:** the "open this artifact after a game" moment is muted compared to Option B.

**Recommendation:** Option C for v1. Lowest risk, easiest to evolve to Option B if the "open after a game" moment proves to be the right framing. Keep the route reserved (`/lol/$accountSlug/post-game/$matchId` as a peer route) for a v2 promotion.

## Phasing

### Phase PG1 — Static section on Profile ✅ shipped 2026-05-13

Sibling block to Pregame Ritual, reads the most-recent serious match. Four signals deterministic per match: outcome (streak framing), baseline (largest role-delta of damage / vision), tilt forecast (historical WR after wins/losses), champion read (this match's KDA vs your average on this champion).

- Component: [`apps/web/src/lol/profile/profile-post-game.tsx`](../../../apps/web/src/lol/profile/profile-post-game.tsx).
- Shared `RitualSignal` model + `SignalTile` extracted to [`apps/web/src/lol/profile/ritual-tile.tsx`](../../../apps/web/src/lol/profile/ritual-tile.tsx) so Pregame and Post-game read as a paired set.
- Filters via `useSeriousMatches` — ARAM/Arena don't trigger a post-game read (the role-baseline and lane-phase reads wouldn't fit).
- Commit `a7f3299` (bundled with PG2).

### Phase PG2 — SSE-driven highlight ✅ shipped 2026-05-13

Pulse + slight scale lift on the tile grid when a new matchId arrives. No new SSE listener — `useSeriousMatches → useMatchWindow` already invalidates on the existing flow, so the latest matchId change is the trigger.

- Hook: [`apps/web/src/lol/profile/use-new-match-notice.ts`](../../../apps/web/src/lol/profile/use-new-match-notice.ts). Suppresses the initial mount transition (undefined → first matchId) so a fresh profile load doesn't fire. 6s TTL.
- Motion: tinted ring (emerald for wins, rose for losses) animates 0 → 0.55 alpha → 0 over the TTL; `scale: [1, 1.005, 1]` lift. `useReducedMotion` short-circuits both.
- Commit `a7f3299` (bundled with PG1).
- Live-verified 2026-05-14 — ring fired on first Profile open after a new match arrived via SSE (the initial-mount suppression rules out a refresh false-positive); end-to-end tile re-derive on a real new match arrival confirmed the same day.

### Phase PG3 — Lane-phase / comeback depth ✅ shipped 2026-05-13

`buildGameShapeSignal` reads `teamGoldDiffAt15` for a lane-phase / comeback narrative. Gated on the `csAt15 === 0 && goldAt15 === 0` sentinel so pre-Phase-B rows fall back to the v1 set unchanged. When timeline data exists the signal slots into position 2 (right after outcome), displacing the champion read.

- Six narrative cells per outcome × shape combination: stomp-converted / led-and-closed / comeback-win / let-it-slip / hard-stomped / lost-behind, plus an even-at-15 fallback.
- Thresholds: `< 1.5k` gold-diff at 15 = "even"; `≥ 5k` = stomp tier with emphasized phrasing.
- Commit `3007552`.

### Phase PG4 (optional) — Peer-route artifact

Promote to `/lol/$accountSlug/post-game/$matchId` as a peer route opened via a "View the read" link on the Profile section. Becomes the share-friendly artifact (calm Wrapped, but per-game).

- Reuses the same component shell, denser layout, OG-image variant. Ties to the recap-density expansion arc.

## Cross-cutting decisions to make before Phase PG1

1. **How many signals on v1?** 3 is calm; 4 is denser. Recommendation: build the helpers for 4, render 3 deterministically per match by priority order (outcome → baseline → tilt → champion), drop the lowest-priority muted tile.
2. **Most-recent match scope.** Reads from `useCachedMatchesWindow(account, 100)` and takes index 0. ARAM games — include or skip? Recommendation: include but the baseline signal sits out (ARAM has no role baseline). Matches pregame ritual's treatment.
3. **Match-card morph back to detail.** If the user clicks the post-game card, should it morph into the full match detail page (the `layoutId` morph from match list)? Recommendation: yes, reuse the same `layoutId` so the post-game card *is* the match card visually.
4. **Empty state.** When the account has no matches in the window — muted "Play a game and we'll have a read after it" empty card. Use the existing `EmptyMatchesIllustration`.

## Why this is a case-study candidate

The arc embodies the tonal bet of the whole app: stats sites describe; vyoh.gg *talks*. A post-game close-the-loop block is the single clearest demonstration of the verdict pattern applied where it matters most. The write-up frame writes itself:

- The pattern (`ConclusionCard` + signal tile model) is a generalizable abstraction, not a one-off.
- The reuse story is concrete: pregame and post-game share 80% of the computation surface and 100% of the visual language.
- The SSE story comes along for free — the post-game section is the most visible application of the existing real-time invalidation work.

Companion to (or replacement for) the open ConclusionCard-pattern case study tracked in [case-study-topics.md](../cross-cutting/case-study-topics.md).

## Status

- **2026-05-13** — arc framed, promoted from vNext.
- **2026-05-13** — PG1 + PG2 shipped (commit `a7f3299`). Section live on Profile, paired with Pregame Ritual; SSE-driven pulse fires off the existing match-window invalidation path.
- **2026-05-13** — PG3 shipped (commit `3007552`). Game-shape signal added behind the timeline-projected sentinel.
- **2026-05-14** — PG2 pulse live-verified on a real new-match arrival; full PG1–PG3 end-to-end re-derive confirmed after a fresh match landed on Profile.
- **2026-05-20** — PG4 closed as won't-do. Profile-framing close-the-loop has been live and verified for six days and delivers the read where the user looks; a separate peer-route + OG-image share artifact is a distinct case-study/share-loop bet, not a continuation of the close-the-loop arc. If a "share my game" need surfaces independently, promote a fresh artifact note from vNext rather than reviving PG4 as part of this arc.

## Open questions

1. **Surface placement — A, B, or C above.** Recommendation in this doc is C, but Option B (route segment, auto-open on SSE) is the more demoable choice and may justify the routing complexity.
2. **Pulse / highlight cadence on SSE.** How long should the "new match arrived" emphasis last — a few seconds, until the user interacts, or until the next page change? Probably 6–8 seconds with a fade.
3. **Multi-account post-game.** When two whitelisted accounts both finish a game close together, does each Profile show its own post-game card independently (yes — it's per-account already), or does a global "two games finished" surface appear? Defer; per-account is fine.
4. **Notification beyond Profile.** Toast on other tabs when a new match lands? Currently the only signal is the SSE-driven list refresh. A toast might be the cheapest moment-aware add for users who aren't on Profile. Park.
