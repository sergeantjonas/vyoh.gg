# Repo conventions

Portable workflow, environment, and architectural rules for vyoh.gg. Committed so they survive across machines. 

Code-site-specific facts live as comments at the relevant source location, not here. This file holds only what is too cross-cutting to attach to one file.

## Architecture

### Per-stream routes; `/` is synthesis-only

Each integration owns its own top-level route tree: `/lol/...`, `/steam/...`, and future streams get their own (`/music` for Spotify, `/code` for GitHub + WakaTime, etc.). Never embed Steam-specific components into LoL-scoped routes (e.g. `/lol/$accountSlug/*`) — and don't do the reverse.

`/` is for cross-stream *synthesis* — content that combines multiple streams into one verdict (chronotype hour-bucketing across LoL + commits, "what am I doing right now" picking the dominant live stream). A "top tracks this week" or "latest commit" tile on `/` is wrong-place; it belongs on its per-stream route. `/` may carry at most a single curated highlight per stream that links into the deep route.

**Why:** Domain separation matches the data model (`/lol/$accountSlug` is one Riot account; Steam has nothing to do with that account) and keeps the portfolio framing clean (each integration becomes its own case study, with `/` as the aggregator). If `/` accumulates one stream-feed per integration, the synthesis story drowns and the page reads as a mixed-bag dashboard rather than a self-portrait.

**How to apply:** When scoping any new integration UI, default to its own route subtree. Only put something on `/` if it is explicitly cross-stream synthesis. If a working note says "Profile-page section placeholder" without naming the page, treat it as ambiguous and confirm the surface — don't assume the LoL profile page just because it has stacked `Profile*` components.

## Environment

### Owner timezone: Brussels

Owner lives near Brussels, Belgium. Use `Europe/Brussels` for any owner-local time bucketing (chronotype hour buckets, daily streak boundaries, "today/yesterday" framing) — not Berlin or UTC.

### Restart Firefox after a devcontainer rebuild

Blank pages or empty-status rows on `localhost:<port>` after a devcontainer rebuild are stale HTTP/2 streams that the browser is holding from the previous container. Storage clears, extension toggling, and ETP exemptions won't fix it — only a Firefox restart does. Mention this proactively if symptoms match.

## Workflow

### Simulating network hangs for timeout verification

Use `10.255.255.1` (RFC1918 black-hole address — TCP SYN goes nowhere, packets drop silently) when verifying that a timeout actually fires. Do not use `.invalid` TLDs (DNS resolves instantly to failure — different code path) or DevTools request blocking (also different code path). Only `10.255.255.1` reproduces a true network-level hang.

### Ask for a dev server restart instead of routing around stale state

When a non-reloaded API/web blocks live verification (Nest cold-start, new env var not picked up, Vite plugin change not HMR'd), ask the owner to restart the relevant dev server immediately. Do not invent workarounds that produce false positives — the cost of asking is a few seconds; the cost of debugging stale state is much higher.
